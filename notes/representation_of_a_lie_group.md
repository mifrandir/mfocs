# Representation
A *representation of a [Lie group](lie_group.md) on a finite-dimensional vector
space $V$* is a homomorphism $\rho:G\to\text{Aut}(V)$.

Here the group structure on $\text{Aut}(V)$ is given by composition.
The manifold structure follows as each $\phi\in\text{Aut}(V)$ is given
by its action on basis elements $e_i\mapsto \phi(e_i)$., i.e. its basis
are the $n^2$ functions $\delta_{ij}(e_i) = e_j$.

# Example 
- $G=GL(n,\mathbb{R})$, $V=\mathbb{R}^n$, $\rho(A)x = Ax$.

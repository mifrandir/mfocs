# Definition
We have a category $\textbf{Man}^\infty$ of smooth manifolds and smooth
functions between them.

# Properties
- $\textbf{Man}^\infty$ has all finite products as inherited from
  $\textbf{Set}$.
- There's an isomorphims of categories
  $$\textbf{Man}^\infty \cong \left({C^\infty\text{-algebras}}\right)^\text{op}.$$

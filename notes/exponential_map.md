# Exponential map
The *exponential map* $\exp:\text{Lie}(G)\to G$ is given by
$$
X\mapsto \phi_1(e)
$$
where $\phi$ is the [flow](flow_of_a_vector_field.md) of $X$.

# Properties
- For a Lie group homomorphism $F:G\to H$, $\exp(dF_e(X_e)) = F(\exp(X_e))$.
- Let $G$ be connected. Then the following are equivalent:
  1. $G$ is abelian, and
  2. $\exp : \text{Lie}(G)\to G$ is a group homomorphism,
  3. $G\cong T^k \times \mathbb{R}^{n-k}$
- $\im(\exp)\subseteq G_0$ where $G_0\ni e$ is a connected component.
- $\exp((s+t)X)=\exp(sX)\exp(tX)$
- ${(\exp(X))}^{-1}=\exp(-X)$
- $\exp(X)$ has $n$th roots for all $n$

> Every connected Lie group is generated by elements of the form $exp(X)$.

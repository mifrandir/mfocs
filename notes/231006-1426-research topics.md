# Aleks Kissinger: ZX completeness
- ZX is universally complete
- caveat: proofs may be exponential in size (if it weren't so then `P=NP`)
- some subsets of ZX are complete with suitably well-behaved proofs (TODO: which ones?)
- what *other* such subsets can we find?
- related to
  - circuit specification ("does a given circuit implement a given
    specification?")
  - circuit synthesis ("how do you turn a quantum program into a
    physical circuit?")
  - circuit generation ("given a specification, what is a circuit that
    implements it?")

# Aleks Kissinger: quantum causal inference
- causal networks are an analog to Bayesian networks
- extensively studied in the classical case
- question: what are the quantum analogues?
- references: @jacobs2018, @allen2017

# Sam Staton: QBSes

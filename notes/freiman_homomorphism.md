# Freiman homomorphism
A *Freiman $s$-homomorphism* is a map $f:A\to B$ such that
$$
\sum_{j=1}^d a_j = \sum_{j=1}^d a'_j
$$
implies
$$
\sum_{j=1}^d \phi(a_j) = \sum_{j=1}^d \phi(a'_j).
$$

There is a category $\text{Frei}(G,s)$ of subsets of $G$ and Freiman
$s$-homomorphisms and, for all $2\leq s\leq s'$ an inclusion
$$
\text{Frei}(G,s')\to\text{Frei}(G,s).
$$

(For more properties see page 38 of the notes.)

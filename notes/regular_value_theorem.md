Let $f:M\to N$ be a differentiable map.

A *regular value* of $f$ is a $q\in N$ for which, at all points
$p\in {f}^{-1}(q)$, the differential $d_p f:T_p M \to T_{f(p)}N$ is surjective.

Let $q\in N$ be a regular value.

# Statement

Then
1. ${f}^{-1}(q)$ is a submanifold of $M$
2. If ${f}^{-1}(q)$ is non-empty, then
  $$\dim(Y) = \dim(X) - \dim\left({{f}^{-1}(q)}\right).$$
